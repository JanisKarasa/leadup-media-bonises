          <h3>Use and Disclosure of Information</h3>

          <p>
            We use this information in order to operate the Site and
            Applications and improve your experience:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              We will display your personally identifiable information on your
              profile according to the preferences you set. We will use your
              name so that you are recognizable on our database and so that we
              can personalize your experience. We will use your email address to
              contact you from time to time and may also use it for security
              reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. You can
              control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive in
              your email preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may use the information collected automatically, such as your
              IP address, information stored via cookies, and information about
              how you use the Site and/or Applications to develop statistics and
              aggregate information about the number of people who visit the
              Site and to customize the Site and/or Applications. We may share
              this information with third parties to help us improve our service
              and better serve our users.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use an outside company to serve advertisements on our site. In
              the process of serving advertisements, cookies are placed in your
              browser’s cookie file and may use information, such as IP
              addresses but excluding your name, address, email address or
              telephone number, about your visits to this and other Web sites in
              order to provide advertisements on this site and other Web sites
              about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By
              delivering ads on the Site, our ad serving vendor is able to
              record what ads a user — identified by the unique cookie — has
              seen, and what pages on the Site the user was viewing when the ads
              were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other
              ad delivery information (e.g., what type of operating system your
              computer uses) collected from your visits to the Site and other
              sites not affiliated with Best California Games. This
              non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad
              serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you
              see online at the Site and other sites not affiliated with Best
              California Games. Unlike the cookies Best California Games uses in
              other parts of our site, cookies received with banner ads are
              collected by our ad serving vendor and we do not have access to
              this information. Additionally, some ads served are generated by
              other third party ad serving systems that also may place a cookie
              or transparent GIF files on your browser to provide web usage
              information to those third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may provide your personally identifiable information and the
              data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the
              vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in
              providing our services to you. Such third party entities will be
              obligated to use your personally identifiable information solely
              to provide the services to us.

            <li>
              Personally identifiable information about you, including the
              contents of your online communications, may be accessed or
              disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court
              order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in
              which we believe, in our sole discretion, that the Site or the
              Application is being used in the commission of a crime; when we
              have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a
              threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary
              either to protect our rights or property, or for us to render the
              service you have requested.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personally identifiable information collected in connection with
              your use of the Site or the Applications may be stored in any
              country where we or our service providers maintain facilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a
              friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask
              them for the friend’s name and email address. We will
              automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to
              visit the Site. We store this information for the sole purpose of
              sending this one-time email.

              We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems

              information may remain archived after we delete the information
              from our active database. We also may maintain archives for
              disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.

              We reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable

          <h3>Collection of Information on Other Sites</h3>

          <p>
            This privacy statement applies only to information collected by Best
            California Games. The Site contains links to other sites and
            services that are not owned or controlled by Best California Games,
            including our affiliates. Please be aware that these sites have
            their own privacy policies and that Best California Games is not
            responsible for their privacy practices. We therefore encourage you
            to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects
            personally identifiable information.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Cookies are a common Internet technology. Many web sites use
              cookies to provide useful features for their users. Cookies are
              small files that are written or downloaded to your computer’s hard
              drive when you access a site. They allow us to store and quickly
              retrieve login information on your computer and provide data that
              we can use to improve the quality of our service. Most Internet
              browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer,
              you can set your browser to refuse cookies, although you may not
              be able to take full advantage of the Site or the Applications if
              you do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may link information stored in cookies such as your age, gender
              and country with your personally identifiable information and we
              may use such information to gather statistics about the number of
              people who visit the Site and to customize the Site and/or
              Applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              We and our advertisers may set and access cookies or use other
              technologies such as web beacons (which are electronic files that
              allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to
              access certain cookies) in order to present advertisements on the
              Site or Applications. We and our advertisers may also use third
              party ad networks to help present and manage advertisements. These
              ad networks use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on
              your computer to help present, better target, and measure the
              effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over
              time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or
              predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. We
              may share certain non-personally identifiable information about
              you (such as user age and zip code) with ad network providers, to
              help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad
              networks.

              settings on the Site and Applications. Consequently, you
