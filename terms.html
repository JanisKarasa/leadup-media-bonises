          <h2>4. VIOLATIONS OF TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</h2>
          <p>
            If you believe that any content on the Site (including, without
            limitation, User Materials) violates any of the terms of these
            Terms, please send us a message about it as set forth below.
          </p>

          <p>
            You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult
            to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then
            you will be liable to pay Bonises any and all actual damages, to the
            extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated for any
            breach of these Terms, but in any event, no less than one thousand
            dollars ($1,000) for each material breach.
          </p>

          <h2>5. LIMITED NON-COMMERCIAL LICENSE TO USE APPLICATIONS</h2>
          <p>
            Bonises may but is not obligated to offer you, as it may determine
            in its sole discretion, the ability to use Applications, if you so
            desire. For example, Bonises may provide chat areas, bulletin
            boards, e-mail functions, software and services that allow you to
            download specific content from the Sites to your computer,
            multi-player games and software that allows you to create greetings,
            puzzles, photographs, musical compositions and mixes, music videos
            and cartoons. Without limiting your obligations and restrictions
            described herein, your limited license to use the Applications is
            subject to the following conditions:
          </p>

          <p>
            The Applications that are made available to you are the copyrighted
            work of Bonises and/or its licensors. The use of each Application is
            governed by the end user license agreement (EULA) that accompanies
            or is included in the Application or is expressly stated on the Site
            pages accompanying the Application and these Terms. In the event
            that no EULA accompanies the Application, then the Terms shall
            govern your use of the Application. You may not download or use any
            Application from the Site without agreeing to the EULA, if any, and
            these Terms. Certain Applications may be owned by third parties and
            distributed under a third party EULA and you agree that Bonises
            shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating
            to your dealings with such third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless expressly stated otherwise in the EULA, you are granted only
            a limited license to download and/or use the Application from a
            single computer for personal and non-commercial purposes. You may
            not make copies of or distribute the Application or electronically
            transfer the Application from one computer to another or over a
            network, nor may you separate any content from an associated
            Application. You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or
            otherwise attempt to discover the source code of any of the software
            used to provide the Site or the Applications or any part thereof.
            You may not rent, lease or sublicense the Application. You may not
            create derivative works of the Application and you may not export
            the Application in violation of any U.S. or foreign law, rule or
            regulation. All rights in Applications not specifically granted to
            you in writing by Bonises are reserved to Best California Games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonises may cease support of any Application at any time in its sole
            discretion, as further described in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications you use or download from the Sites may contain third
            party digital rights management systems (DRMS) which may allow for
            communication between your software and the third party and utilize
            security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the
            applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are
            subject to their own license agreements and you agree that Best
            California Games shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of
            any sort relating to the use of the DRMS or your dealings with such
            third parties. The Applications may also contain DRMS produced by
            Bonises which allow for communication between the applications you
            use or download and our systems and which collect information
            describing your computer system in order to prevent illegal or
            unauthorized use of the applications. More specifically, the DRMS
            for subscription services and Applications licensed from the Site
            may transmit certain information when you either enter a purchase
            key or sign in with your subscription service user name and
            password.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonises will try to provide the Applications with minimum
            disruptions. However there is no guarantee that the Applications
            will always function without disruptions, delay or other
            imperfections. Bonises shall not be responsible for any connection
            or access to the Site or Applications by you or the quality of the
            transmission of any information passing between you and the Site.
            You will be responsible for providing your own communications
            equipment to access the Site and use of the Applications via the
            Internet or WAP service, and the Internet/WAP access charges
            thereon. You recognize that Bonises shall not be responsible for any
            reduced functionality resulting from, or in connection with, your
            use of the Site or Applications via WAP. Bonises may change
            technical features in order to keep pace with the latest demands and
            technological developments or to comply with any regulations. Best
            California Games may also have to repair, improve, and/or upgrade
            the Applications and this may require us to restrict, limit,
            suspend, interfere and/or interrupt the Applications.
          </p>

          <h2>7. PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
          <p>
            Bonises respects your right to privacy and understands that visitors
            to Bonises need to be in control of their personal information. To
            that end Bonises has developed a Privacy Policy, and you should
            review it carefully. Your use of the Site is your consent to the
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h2>8. ADS AND MALWARE</h2>
          <p>
            We take great care and pride in creating this Site. We are always on
            the lookout for technical glitches that effect how the Site works.
            When we find them on our end, we will try to fix them.
            Unfortunately, your home computer may cause some glitches that
            effect how you see our Site — and that is beyond our control.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you experience any unusual behavior, content or ads on the Site,
            it may be the result of Malware on your computer. Malware — short
            for MALicious softWARE — is a term used to broadly classify a form
            of software which is installed in a computer system with malicious
            intentions, usually without the owner’s knowledge or permission.
            Malware includes computer viruses, key loggers, malicious active
            content, rogue programs and dialers, among others. While we
            continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that
            everything on the Site is working properly, sometimes Malware
            programs on your personal computer may interfere with your
            experience on our Site and on other sites that you visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that we cannot be responsible for the effects of any
            third-party software including Malware on your computer system.
            Please make sure to carefully read the Help or Customer Support
            areas of any software download site.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do discover any Malware on your system, we also suggest you
            speak with a qualified computer technician.

          <h2>9. SUBMITTING USER MATERIALS AND LICENSE GRANT</h2>
          <p>
            Bonises will own all right, title and interest in and to all
            derivative works and compilations of User Material that are created
            by Bonises, including all worldwide intellectual property rights
            therein. You agree to execute and deliver such documents and provide
            all assistance reasonably requested by Bonises to give to Bonises
            the full benefit of the rights granted to Bonises by you. You agree
            that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use
            of any User Material, including any reliance on the accuracy,
            completeness, or usefulness of such User Material.
          </p>
          <p>
            You understand that whether or not such User Materials are published
            on the Site, Bonises does not guarantee any confidentiality with
            respect to any submissions. Best California Games does not want to
            receive confidential or proprietary information from you through the
            Sites or by email.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the absence of an express written agreement between you and Best
            California Games, any User Materials, information or idea you
            transmit to Bonises by any means may be disseminated or used by
            Bonises or its affiliates without compensation or liability to you
            for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to,
            developing, manufacturing and marketing. You acknowledge, however,
            that because of Best California Games and its affiliates’ position
            in the games industry, other persons, including Bonises’s employees,
            may have submitted to Bonises or to others, or may have made public,
            or may hereafter create, submit to Bonises or make public, similar
            or identical material that Best California Games may have the right
            to use. You understand and agree that Best California Games’s use of
            material similar to or identical with the User Materials or
            containing features or elements similar to or identical with those
            contained in the User Materials will not obligate Bonises to
            negotiate with you, nor will it entitle you to any compensation of
            any kind. However, this provision does not apply to personal
            information that is subject to our privacy policy, which is subject
            to separate provisions. Best California Games does not claim
            ownership in User Materials you submit; however, by submitting User
            Materials in any form to Best California Games, in addition to other
            provisions of the Terms, you hereby waive any and all moral rights
            in connection with the User Materials and you automatically grant
            Bonises a royalty-free, fully-paid, world-wide, non-exclusive,
            sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), perpetual and irrevocable
            and assignable right and license but not the obligation, to use,
            host, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, modify,
            publish, exhibit, broadcast, edit, (e.g., for promotional uses,

            rules), compress adapt, promote, package with other works, convert
            for streaming, distribute, transmit, translate, manufacture, market,
            license, broadcast, rent and lease and otherwise exploit the User
            Materials, or any portion thereof, and sublicense others to do so
            (including through multiple tiers) in any form, medium or technology
            now known or later developed, including without limitation on the
            Site and third party websites and if you so choose when uploading,
            streaming, submitting, emailing, posting, publishing or otherwise
            transmitting any User Material to Bonises or on the Site or
            thereafter, such license shall include the right to copy, transmit,
            display and redistribute such User Material in any form, medium or
            technology now known or later developed, including without
            limitation on third party websites. You further grant to each user
            of the Site and Applications a perpetual, personal, non-commercial,
            non-transferable, non-exclusive license to access and view your User
            Material and if you so choose when uploading, streaming, submitting,
            emailing, posting, publishing or otherwise transmitting any User
            Material to Bonises or on the Site or thereafter, such license to
            each user of the Site or Applications shall include the right to
            copy, transmit, display and redistribute such User Material on third
            party websites. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once
            you, or Bonises, remove or delete a User Material from the Site.
            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing
            license shall survive with respect to any sublicenses granted by
            Bonises until such sublicenses terminate or expire. You obtain no
            rights in any form, media, or technology incorporating the User
            Materials.

            subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, partners and employees
            harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney’s
            fees, arising out of your content and User Materials, your use of
            the Site, your violation of these Terms or your violation of any
            third party’s rights including such party’s intellectual property
            right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right or the
            breach of any law.

          <h2>17. INTERNATIONAL USAGE</h2>
          <p>
            This Site is controlled and operated by Bonises from its offices.
            Bonises makes no representation that the Site, Applications, or
            related information offered by Best California Games are appropriate
            or available in locations where you may access the Site. Those who
            choose to access the Site or use the Applications do so on their own
            initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if
            and to the extent local laws are applicable. Some legal
            jurisdictions have not addressed the legality of online gaming and
            others have specifically made certain types of online gaming
            illegal. We make no representation or warranty with respect to the
            legality or otherwise of (1) the access to and use of the Site
            and/or the Applications, and (2) the making of any deposit of funds
            to Bonises and receipt of any funds from it, under any applicable
            law. We do not intend for anyone to use the Site and/or the
            Applications where such use is illegal. The availability of the Site
            and/or the Applications does not constitute an offer or invitation
            by us to use the Site and/or the Applications in any place in which
            such use is illegal. Use of the Site and/or the Applications is
            forbidden wherever prohibited by any applicable laws. You accept
            sole responsibility for determining whether your use of the Site
            and/or the Applications is legal under any applicable laws. Please
            consult legal counsel in the applicable jurisdiction if you have any
            doubts about the legality of your access to and use of the Site
            and/or the Applications, or the making of any deposits to Bonises
            and receipt of any funds from it, under any applicable laws. We
            shall be entitled to inform relevant authorities, other online
            operators, online service providers and banks, credit card
            companies, electronic payment providers or other financial
            institutions of your identity and of any suspected unlawful,
            fraudulent or improper activity, and you will cooperate fully with
            us to investigate any such activity. Without prejudice to any other
            rights, you agree to indemnify Best California Games for any
            unlawful use of the Site or the Applications.

            18. TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION OF SITE ACCESS; MODIFICATIONS TO
            SITE AND APPLICATIONS
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you violate these Terms, Bonises may terminate or cancel your
            access rights to the Site and/or Applications immediately without
            notice. Bonises may also block your use of the Site and/or
            Applications or direct you to cease using it. If you repeatedly
            violate these Terms, Best California Games will permanently suspend
            your access right to the Site and/or Applications. You agree that
            Bonises, in its sole discretion, for any or no reason, and without
            penalty, may terminate or cancel your access rights to the Site
            and/or Applications and remove and discard all or any part of your
            account and user profile, at any time without prior notice and you
            understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation
            to provide the Site or Applications. Bonises reserves the right at
            any time to modify or discontinue the Site, Applications, or any
            part thereof, with or without notice and you agree that Best
            California Games shall not be liable to you or to any third party
            for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Site,
            Applications, or any part thereof. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive
            or illegal activity may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
            authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies
            Bonises may have at law or in equity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any suspension, termination or cancellation will not affect your
            obligations to Bonises under these Terms (including but not limited
            to ownership, indemnification and limitation of liability), which by
            their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension,
            termination or cancellation.
          </p>

          <h2>19. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Israel without regard
            to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under or
            related in any way to these Terms, the Site or any Application shall
            be litigated or otherwise heard in the appropriate forum in Israel.
          </p>

          <h2>20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms, as amended, your registration forms, and the
            disclosures provided by Bonises and the consents provided by you,
            constitute the entire agreement between you and Bonises. If any
            provision of these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy shall be
            unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision
            shall be deemed severable from these Terms and/or the Privacy
            Policy, as applicable, and shall not affect the validity and
            enforceability of any remaining provisions Bonises’s failure to act
            with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Bonises’s
            right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
          </p>

          <h2>21. NOTICES</h2>
          <p>
            Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in
            writing and given (a) by Bonises via email (in each case to the
            address that you provide), (b) a posting on the Site or (c) by you
            via email to support@Bonises.com or to such other addresses as
            Bonises may specify in writing. The date of receipt will be deemed
